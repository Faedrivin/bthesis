I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Hertzberg and the people of the working group Knowledge Based Systems for their overall support with my thesis.

Particularly I give thanks to Dr. Thomas Wiemann for his great advice and support. His reviews, critiques and ideas helped me a lot tackling the topic and solving the problems I had to overcome while developing the AMCL6D algorithm.

Additionally many thanks to Lisa Goerke for reading through my thesis and providing lots of valuable feedback and remarks.
